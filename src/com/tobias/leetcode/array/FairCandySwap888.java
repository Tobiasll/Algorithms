/**
 * Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: A[i] is the size of the i-th bar of candy that
 * Alice has, and B[j] is the size of the j-th bar of candy that Bob has.
 *
 * Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the
 * exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy.  (The total amount of candy a person has
 * is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.)
 *
 * Return an integer array ans where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange,
 * and ans[1] is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.
 *
 * If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  It is guaranteed an answer
 * exists.
 *
 * Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2] Output: [1,2] Example 2:
 *
 * Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3] Output: [1,2] Example 3:
 *
 * Input: A = [2], B = [1,3] Output: [2,3] Example 4:
 *
 * Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4] Output: [5,4]
